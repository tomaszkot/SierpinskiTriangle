# SierpinskiTriangle

Implementation of [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) in form of so called 'Chaos game'.
There are two version provided:

1. C# - Windows Forms implementation. Triangle is formed dynamically as button is pressed.

2. Julia - animation showing triangle being formed dynamically. Each frame is saved to a separate image file.
You need a Julia environment to run it. Somehow environment from https://julialang.org/downloads/ was not working fine for me, I had to use https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro.html

Here is a preview of the last [image](Julia/0000000021.png).
